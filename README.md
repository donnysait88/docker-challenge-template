# Docker Challenge Project

This repository contain Docker project aims to develop technical skills using containerization tool which comprise of 2 challenges.  
- Challenge 1 involved introducing how to use Docker to serve static pages.
- Challenge 2 involves introducing the concept of Docker Compose.

## Challenge 1: Simple web server for static web pages

### Objective

This guide aims to teach how to leverage Docker to deploy and serve static websites. By the end, we'll be able to containerize our website and run it in a consistent environment, regardless of the underlying machine.

### Learning Experience

This learning experience will involve a hands-on approach. We'll cover the following:

- Docker Fundamentals: We'll introduce to core Docker concepts like images, containers, and registries.
- Choosing a Web Server: We'll explore popular lightweight web servers like Nginx or BusyBox httpd suitable for serving static content within Docker containers.
- Building a Dockerfile: we'll learn how to create a Dockerfile, a text file that instructs Docker on how to build a container image containing our website's files and the chosen web server.
- Running the Container: We'll guide through building and running the containerized website, allowing to access it locally through the browser.

### Learning Outcome

Upon completing this guide, we'll be able to:

- Explain the benefits of using Docker for serving static websites.
- Build a Docker image for static website using a lightweight web server.
- Run containerized website and access it locally.
- Gain a foundation for deploying website to a cloud platform using Docker containers.

## Challenge 2: Creating a dynamic application

### Objective

The objective was to use Docker Compose to run a containerized Node,js application that exposed API endpoints for server interaction.

### Learning Experience

- Core Concepts: We'll solidify understanding of Docker Compose, including services, volumes, networks, and environment variables.
- Multi-Container Magic: Explore how to define and manage various services within a single ```docker-compose.yml``` file for dynamic application.
- Scaling Up: Discover how to scale individual services within application to handle increased traffic.
- Deployment Strategies: We'll explore strategies for deploying containerized application to different environments.

### Learning Outcome

- Confidently build and manage dynamic applications with Docker Compose.
- Structure the application with separate services for different components.
- Integrate databases and external services seamlessly into the containerized environment.
- Scale the application based on changing requirements.
- Deploy the containerized application with confidence.
