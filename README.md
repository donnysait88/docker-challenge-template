## Challenge 1: Simple web server for static web pages

### Objective

This guide aims to teach you how to leverage Docker to deploy and serve static websites. By the end, you'll be able to containerize your website and run it in a consistent environment, regardless of the underlying machine.

### Learning Experience

This learning experience will involve a hands-on approach. We'll cover the following:

- Docker Fundamentals: We'll introduce you to core Docker concepts like images, containers, and registries.
- Choosing a Web Server: We'll explore popular lightweight web servers like Nginx or BusyBox httpd suitable for serving static content within Docker containers.
- Building a Dockerfile: You'll learn how to create a Dockerfile, a text file that instructs Docker on how to build a container image containing your website's files and the chosen web server.
- Running the Container: We'll guide you through building and running your containerized website, allowing you to access it locally through your browser.

### Learning Outcome

Upon completing this guide, you'll be able to:

- Explain the benefits of using Docker for serving static websites.
- Build a Docker image for your static website using a lightweight web server.
- Run your containerized website and access it locally.
- Gain a foundation for deploying your website to a cloud platform using Docker containers.

## Challenge 2: Creating a dynamic application

### Objective

The objective was to use Docker Compose to run a containerized Node,js application that exposed API endpoints for server interaction.

### Learning Experience

- Explored the setup of a Node.js application within a Docker environment.
- utilized docker compose to manage multi-container Docker application.
- Enhanced understanding of linking services and port mapping.

### Learning Outcome

- Docker compose is an efficient tool for managing complex applications with multiple services.
- Node.js application can be easily scaled and maintained using Docker.
